# bellaBooLang

I'm making a super simple programming language that I think would be a nice intro to programming for my little sister Bella. (nickname is bellaBoo, norm for the language will be camelCase)

- Super simple, no complexity really at all
- (I'm thinking of having basic types (int,char,bool,array of these types) and having simple functions such as print
- MAYBE much later on adding user-definable functions? I have absolutely no experience with anything low-level yet (no compiler experience etc and I'm not good at assembly (yet) so we'll have to see)

Steps I need to take (I think ???)
1. make lexer properly
2. make parser properly (generate proper Abstract Syntax Tree)
3. Make transpiler to C++
4. Make 'compiler' simply transpile a BellaBoo file (.bbo) to C++ and perform the operations in procedural programming style
